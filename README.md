## 📱 Responsive Design

This site is **fully responsive** and adapts to different screen widths using CSS Media Queries. The navbar collapses into a mobile-style menu on smaller screens and hides certain elements for a better experience.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This was my **very first web development project**, built while learning the basics of HTML and CSS. The goals of this project were:

- To understand HTML structure and semantic tags.
- To get hands-on with CSS styling, layouts, and responsiveness.
- To practice building from scratch without frameworks.

I'm still learning, and this project was a great way to reinforce my understanding of how websites are built. 😊

## 🚧 Limitations & To-Do

- No actual backend or JavaScript functionality (buttons/forms don't work yet).
- Images are for UI visuals only — not optimized.
- No GitHub Pages deployment yet (coming soon).
- Some typos and content will be fixed in the next version.

---

## 💪 What's Next

- Add JavaScript for mobile menu toggle and form validation.
- Connect the email form to an actual service like FormSubmit or Netlify Forms.
- Refactor HTML/CSS as I learn best practices.
- Deploy a live version using GitHub Pages.
